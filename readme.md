# 🛡️ ARDA – Autonomous Risk Decision Agent  
**Project 07 – Real-World Python Series**

ARDA is a **production-style insider threat detection and automated response system**  
designed to simulate how real **Security Operations Centers (SOC)** detect, analyze, and respond to risky employee behavior.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Most academic or beginner security projects stop at:
- Logging events
- Displaying raw data
- No real decision-making

**Real companies don’t work like that.**

Security teams care about:
- Behavioral patterns over time
- Privilege misuse
- Risk scoring
- Automated enforcement

> ARDA closes this gap by moving from  
> **logs → intelligence → decisions → enforcement**

## 🔍 What ARDA Does

- Generates realistic employee activity logs
- Detects abnormal behavior patterns
- Computes dynamic behavioral risk scores
- Classifies incidents (Critical / Warning / Safe)
- Triggers autonomous actions:
  - WARN
  - RESTRICT
  - LOCK
- Builds incident reports
- Replays user timelines visually
- Exports incidents as PDF reports
